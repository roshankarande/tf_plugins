This Windows AD provider for Terraform allows you to manage users, groups and group policies in your AD installation.

Please regard this project as experimental. It still requires extensive testing and polishing to mature into production-ready quality. Please [file issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-ad/issues/new/choose) generously and detail your experience while using the provider. We welcome your feedback.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 0.12.x+
* [Windows Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server) 2012R2 or greater 
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.14.x+

## Getting Started

If this is your first time here, you can get an overview of the provider by reading our [introductory blog post](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/manage-active-directory-objects-new-windows-ad-provider-hashicorp-terraform). Otherwise, start by downloading a copy of our latest build from the [registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/ad/latest).

Once you have the plugin installed, review the [docs](docs/) folder to understand which configuration options are available. You can find examples and more in [our examples folder](examples/). Don't forget to run `terraform init` in your Terraform configuration directory to allow Terraform to detect the provider plugin.
